                        <p>Our capstone project was a booking application made for taxi drivers in our area, Lucena City. 
                            Since it's more of a provincial setting, taxi drivers often struggle to find passengers and have 
                            to roam around without a sure destination. To help solve this, our team developed a taxi booking 
                            application for our client. I worked as the front-end developer on this project. It has already 
                            been successfully defended and deployed.</p>

                            Its purpose is to help Qtech clients report issues without needing to ask for help in person. 
                            Instead of face-to-face communication, clients can now send a ticket directly to Qtech's admin to 
                            address their concerns. This project was a team effort, so I was not the only one who worked on it.</p>

                        <h4>Freelance Project</h4>
                        <p>My contracted project was created using Sketchbook, and one person helped me improve 
                            the artwork before we submitted it to the client. He was using Photoshop and was the one 
                            who referred me to that client. I started doing digital art in 2023, and now in 2025, I’ve 
                            improved a lot through hands-on experience and consistent practice.</p>
